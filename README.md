# FRY: A UIKit Interaction Library

FRY is an iOS Library inspired by KIF.  The purpose is to simplify iteractions with UIKit and make writing UI tests simple.

NOTE: Everything is still in alpha, and is subject to change before the 1.0 release.

## Overview
FRY consists of three core features to implement touch driven integration tests:

- View Lookup
- Touch Modeling
- Idle Detection

FRY also includes a helper library, `FRYolator`, which helps create integration tests when it is included in your target.   The goal of FRYolator is to record all input to the target, for later recreation.   FRYolator will currently record and generate unit test commands to playback the following:

- Touch
- Network (Nocilla)

In the future, I hope to include

- Location
- Bluetooth

### View Lookup
Two types of queries are supported, a depth-first query that mimics hitTest traversal, and a query that will return all matching objects.

```obj-c
FRY.accessibilityLabel(@"My Label").present();
FRY.accessibilityLabel(@"My Label").present();
FRY.accessibilityTraits(UIAccessibilityTraitButton).count(14);

// Or the more traditional Objective-C API:
id<FRYLookup> l = [FRY_KEY_WINDOW fry_farthestDescendentMatching:[NSPredicate fry_matchAccessibilityLabel:actionConfirmation]];
XCTAssertNotNil([l fry_representingView]);

```

View lookup is a simple system based on NSPredicate and Keypaths.  Add support to any object (like CALayer or SceneKit) by implementing `-fry_childKeyPaths`, `-fry_representingView`, and `fry_frameInView`.  UIKit support traverses both `accessibilityElements` and `subviews`.

### Touch Synthesis
FRY uses strongly modeled touches to generate UIKit touch events.  This allows for simple arbitrary touch re-creation, and clear API's for creating common touch sequences.

```obj-c
FRY.accessibilityLabel(@"My Label").tap()
FRY.accessibilityLabel(@"My Label").touches([FRYTouch doubleTap])

// Other touch objects:
FRYTouch *t1 = [FRYTouch dragFromPoint:p1 toPoint:p2 forDuration:1];
FRYTouch *t2 = [FRYTouch pinchInToCenterOfPoint:p3 point:p4 duration:1];
// Or, slightly more complex.
FRYcTouch *t3 = [FRYTouch touchStarting:0.000 points:33 xyoffsets:0.941f,0.597f,0.000, 0.934f,0.597f,0.094, 0.919f,0.597f,0.121, 0.853f,0.597f,0.147, 0.801f,0.597f,0.164, 0.750f,0.597f,0.182, 0.686f,0.597f,0.215, 0.667f,0.597f,0.232, 0.625f,0.548f,0.264, 0.610f,0.548f,0.282, 0.571f,0.548f,0.322, 0.547f,0.548f,0.350, 0.542f,0.548f,0.367, 0.534f,0.548f,0.386, 0.532f,0.548f,0.416, 0.527f,0.548f,0.448, 0.522f,0.548f,0.472, 0.517f,0.548f,0.504, 0.517f,0.581f,0.604, 0.512f,0.581f,0.692, 0.510f,0.581f,0.720, 0.505f,0.581f,0.737, 0.500f,0.581f,0.765, 0.505f,0.581f,1.170, 0.510f,0.581f,1.216, 0.515f,0.581f,1.263, 0.517f,0.581f,1.350, 0.522f,0.581f,1.382, 0.525f,0.581f,1.452, 0.520f,0.581f,1.624, 0.515f,0.581f,1.641, 0.510f,0.581f,1.670, 0.500f,0.581f,1.698];
```

Points and touches are specified as multiples of the frame they are dispatched in.   A tap at point 0.5 0.5 will touch in the center of the view, regardless of the views frame.  All touches are dispatched via timers on the main runloop and do not block the main thread.  

### Idle Detection
There is a helper `FRYIdleCheck` that will spin the runloop until all touches are finished and all UI Animations have completed.  This greatly simplifies flow-control, and eliminiates the vast majority of `CFRunLoopRunInMode(kCFRunLoopDefaultMode, 0.5, false)`.  If you find yourself wanting to add these to your tests, consider adding an animation to your UI instead.  

## FRYolator
FRYolator will be enabled when a special tap sequence is performed.   Once enabled, all touch and network activity will be recorded.   When the app is backgrounded and put in the foreground, the event stream will be saved as a .fry file.   Inside the `.fry` bundle are all of the touch events and network communication.

*To Enable Monitoring*
```obj-c
[[FRYolatorUI shared] registerGestureEnablingOnView:self.window];
```

FRY will attempt to use relative coordinates with accessibility lookup information for the view that was touched.  This will maximize the reliability of these commands when UI changes occur.  If no accessibility information can be found, absoulte screen coordinates will be used.

## Installation

Add FRY to your Podfile to install.   If you want to use touch recording, add FRYolator to your application target

```
pod 'FRY'
```

## Why Not KIF?
KIF is amazing framework that has pushed forward UI testing on iOS.  However, I was unable to completely understand or trust the code base.  There are tons of work arounds for UIKit issues spread around the code, without a clear understanding of why, or if they're still applicable to current versions of iOS.  The core design difference with KIF that pushed me to write FRY without looking to maintain compatibility is that looking up a view can modify the view heirarchy to find it.   This causes a lot of bizarre issues, and it is not usually what I want from a testing perspective.

## Design Goals
- Complete Code Coverage and UIKit functionality.
- Clear separation of query and touching.  UIView lookup will never modify the view heirarchy.
- Use simple logic to implement behavior, and categories to hide complex UIKit implementation details.
- Minimize knowledge of and checks against UIKit private classes.
- Isolate runloop spinning.

### Design Questions
- I've never used so many categories, and I'm not sure how to best organize them.
