FRY is an iOS Testing Library inspired by KIF.  The main goals

- Provide powerful touch synthesis.
- Provide view lookup via UIAccessibility or NSPredicate.
- Allow tests to operate on or off main thread.
- Maximize authentic interactions when possible, driving events via API calls otherwise.
- Keep library logic clean and accomidate UIKit quirks via category extensions.
