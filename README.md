FRY is an iOS Testing Library inspired by KIF.  The purpose is to simplify the creation and execution of UI tests that involve touch synthesis.

NOTE: Everything is still in alpha, and is subject to change before the 1.0 release.

# Overview
FRY consists of four features to help writing integration tests:

- View Lookup
- Touch Synthesis
- Runloop helper
- Touch Recording and Playback

## View Lookup
View lookup is a simple NSPredicate system.  Two types of queries are supported, a depth first query that mimics hitTest traversal, and a query that will return all matching objects.  Both the accessibilityElements and subviews are searched, and categories on NSPredicate enable common accessibility queries.

```obj-c
#define FRY_KEY UIApplication.sharedApplication.keyWindow
[FRY_KEY fry_enumerateDepthFirstViewMatching:[NSPredicate fry_matchAccessibilityLabel:actionConfirmation]
                                          usingBlock:^(UIView *view, CGRect frameInView) {
                                          }];
```

## Touch Synthesis
FRY uses strongly modeled touches to generate UIKit touch events.  This allows for simple arbitrary touch re-creation, and clear API's for creating common touch sequences.

```obj-c
[FRY_KEY fry_simulateTouch:[FRYSyntheticTouch tap]
         onSubviewMatching:[NSPredicate fry_matchInteractableAccessibilityLabel:accessibilityLabel]];
# Other touch objects:
FRYSyntheticTouch *t1 = [FRYSyntheticTouch dragFromPoint:p1 toPoint:p2 forDuration:1];
FRYSyntheticTouch *t2 = [FRYSyntheticTouch pinchInToCenterOfPoint:p3 point:p4 duration:1];
# Or, slightly more complex.
FRYSyntheticTouch *t3 = [FRYSyntheticTouch touchStarting:0.000 points:33 xyoffsets:0.941f,0.597f,0.000, 0.934f,0.597f,0.094, 0.919f,0.597f,0.121, 0.853f,0.597f,0.147, 0.801f,0.597f,0.164, 0.750f,0.597f,0.182, 0.686f,0.597f,0.215, 0.667f,0.597f,0.232, 0.625f,0.548f,0.264, 0.610f,0.548f,0.282, 0.571f,0.548f,0.322, 0.547f,0.548f,0.350, 0.542f,0.548f,0.367, 0.534f,0.548f,0.386, 0.532f,0.548f,0.416, 0.527f,0.548f,0.448, 0.522f,0.548f,0.472, 0.517f,0.548f,0.504, 0.517f,0.581f,0.604, 0.512f,0.581f,0.692, 0.510f,0.581f,0.720, 0.505f,0.581f,0.737, 0.500f,0.581f,0.765, 0.505f,0.581f,1.170, 0.510f,0.581f,1.216, 0.515f,0.581f,1.263, 0.517f,0.581f,1.350, 0.522f,0.581f,1.382, 0.525f,0.581f,1.452, 0.520f,0.581f,1.624, 0.515f,0.581f,1.641, 0.510f,0.581f,1.670, 0.500f,0.581f,1.698];
```

Points and touches are specified as multiples of the frame they are dispatched in.   So a tap at point 0.5 0.5 will touch in the center of the view, regardless of the views frame.

## Runloop Helper
FRY simplifies runloop management of UIKit code (and FRY touch synthesis), with a runloop helper that waits until all animations are complete, all touches have been dispatched, and user interaction is complete.

```obj-c
[[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] fry_waitForIdle];
```

## Touch Recording and Playback
A side effect of strong touch modeling is that FRY can record touch events in your application, for later re-creation.  These touches are printed out as the FRY command to reproduce the touch in a unit test.

**Enable Monitoring**
```obj-c
[[FRYEventMonitor sharedEventMonitor] enable];
```

FRY will attempt to determine an accessibility lookup for the view that was touched, and include relative-touch coordinates, and will avoid using screen coordinates if possible.   This should maximize the durability of these commands.

# Installation

Add FRY to your Podfile to install.   If you want to use touch recording, add FRY to your application target, otherwise add FRY to your test target.

```
   pod 'FRY', :git => 'git@github.com:Raizlabs/FRY.git'
```

# Design Goals
- Clear separation of query and touching.  UIView lookup will never modify the view heirarchy.
- Isolate runloop spinning.
- Keep library logic clean and accomidate UIKit "quirks" via UIView category extensions.
