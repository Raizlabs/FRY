# Touch
Touch synthesis is a key portion of interacting with UIKit. Ideally, no private API's would need to be used, and everything would be driven with touches. However due to performance (Keyboard) and implementation time (Scrolling), this is not the case.

## Touch Modeling
FRY performs some modeling of touches that specify touches as a point in time, or multiple points in time. Then `FRYTouchDispatch`, transforms the `FRYTouch` objects into `FRYActiveTouch` objects, which ensure that the touch is properly sent through the `UITouch` lifecycle, with `UITouchPhaseBegan`, `UITouchPhaseMoved`, and `UITouchPhaseEnded` events occurring for all touch objects, at the right time. This separation of modeling from dispatch, allows for simple touch declarations, and for easy touch recording.

Touch Examples:

*Pinch*
```obj-c
[FRYTouch pinchInToCenterOfPoint:p3 point:p4 duration:1];
```

*Complex, recorded interaction*
```obj-c

```

## Relative Coordinates
Points and touches can be specified as multiples of the frame they are dispatched in. A tap at point 0.5 0.5 will touch in the center of the view, regardless of the views frame. This allows specified touch sequences to have as much durability as possible in response to view layout changes. This is especially important for custom recorded gestures.
