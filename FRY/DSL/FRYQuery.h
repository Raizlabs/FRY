/**
 *  FRYQuery provides a consistent DSL to lookup and interact with UI components, as well
 *  as mechanisms to retry queries until they are satisfied, and report failures to test 
 *  frameworks.
 * 
 *  A FRYQuery object has a focus, which by default points to `[UIApplication sharedApplication]`,
 *  which will query all subviews on all windows. The lookup methods provide predicates which 
 *  further focus the query onto specific elements, and multiple lookup methods can be chained
 *  together to further focus the lookup. Once the query is specific enough, an action can be 
 *  performed to simulate a touch, scroll a scrollview, or select entered text.
 *
 *  FRYQuery can perform two kinds of lookup. A query of everything matching a predicate,
 *  or the most shallow element that matches the predicate. For actions involving interaction,
 *  the query is turned shallow, so only the first matching view is used.  For queries that 
 *  check the state of the view hierarchy, all views are returned, unless `shallow()` is called.
 *
 *  There is one lookup helper, `lookupByAccessibilityLabel`, which will perform a search that 
 *  matches the accessibilityLabel, is on the screen, and is not hidden. This is provided as a
 *  convienence, and is the most common lookup to use in the majority of cases.
